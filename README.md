# MVP by Deborah Scordo

 This MVP will use Express, mySQL and Vue 3 to create an online shop for the business _Ariadna Scordo Handmade_.

## Set up instructions

 To initialise the backend server type `npm start` in the terminal.
 To initialise the frontend, type `npm run dev` in the client folder.

## Components

### The main components are

- PreviousWork: displays examples of work (already sold/gifted).
- Catalog: displays products available to purchase.
- Form for custom order requests (desireable but lower priority).
- Admin View component to receive custom orders and upload/update products (desireable but lower priority).

The first two components will use the table "products" and the form will use the table "customorders".

### Other components that may be produced if time permits include

- About Us.
- Contact Us.
- Terms and Conditions.
- Delivery and returns.

As these components are static they are low priority.
