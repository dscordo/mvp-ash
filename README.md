 # MVP by Deborah Scordo

 This MVP will use Express, mySQL and Vue to create an online shop for the business _Ariadna Scordo Handmade_.

 ## Components

 ### The main components are:

 - PreviousWork: displays examples of work (already sold/gifted).
 - Catalog: displays products available to purchase.
 - Form for custom order requests (desireable but lower priority).

The first two components will use the table "products" and the form will use the table "customorders".
 
 ### Other components that may be produced if time permits include:

 - About Us.
 - Contact Us.
 - Terms and Conditions.
 - Delivery and returns.

As these components are static they are low priority.
